# Java TDD

This is my personal repository regarding all things TDD with Java. I'm currently using Spring Boot as a
scaffolding framework, since it comes with a full testing development kit.

On this repository I use both JUnit5 and Mockito2.

I've developed a simple calculator to test a standalone JUnit5 unit tests, and developed a database-like repository to simulate CRUD operations, for this I use both JUnit5 and Mockito2.
